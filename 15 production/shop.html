<p>$5.00 // 6oz. / / 2 servings</p>
<p>Maltagliati directly translates to "poorly cut" in Italian. They differ in shape, size and thickness. The most classic use of Maltagliati is in bean soup but it can also be paired well with thick tomato and cream sauces. It is my personal favorite and I hope you find that you love it too!</p></div>
